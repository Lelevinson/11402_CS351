# 11402_CS351 — AI-Assisted Software Development

## About Me

Hi! I'm **Levinson** (Student ID: **1123542**). I'm currently studying AI-Assisted Software Development (CS351) and exploring how artificial intelligence can be integrated into the software development lifecycle.

## What This Repository Is For

This repository serves as my coursework portfolio for **CS351 — AI-Assisted Software Development**. It contains assignments, projects, notes, and other materials produced throughout the course. Topics covered include:

- Prompt engineering for code generation
- AI-driven debugging and refactoring
- Automated code review
- Ethical considerations of AI in software engineering
- Practical application of large language models (LLMs) as development aids

### How Files & Folders Are Organized

| Folder         | Purpose                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assignments/` | Individual homework and lab submissions, each in its own sub-folder (e.g., `assignments/hw1/`) |
| `projects/`    | Course projects with their own README and source code                                          |
| `notes/`       | Personal study notes, cheat sheets, and reference links                                        |
| `docs/`        | Static site content published via GitHub Pages                                                 |

Each assignment or project folder contains its own `README.md` describing the task, approach, and any AI tools used.
